Collectively, the gold mining stocks make up a commodity basket and should be regarded as a single investment. Due to the inherent risk in junior miners and dearth of information available, it's best to use a basket as a proxy for gold. Before the end of the year, I will shift around the weightings and add new companies as well. Curious what thoughts are on this mix of tech-heavy etfs

Some other minor misc. Seeking Guidance from Experienced Investors - 

Everything I learned about investing has been on my own, not much of a support system in my family. I’m 36 years old, the best thing I’ve done so far was during 2020 I bought all Airliner stocks/Nvidia shares at discount. 

Couple years ago, I sold half of my shares of nvidia to help pay off debt. It’s been real tough out here, with inflation/COL and all that noise. 

Holdings: 250 shares of NVDA left. 
                 27 shares of INTC.

I’ve got a great retirement from work, pension/401k balance is with both $375k at my age and growing. 

I’m looking for advice on where to expand, I’m going to be contributing about $1,600 per month to buying ETF’s. I have $8,000 right now to invest. Goal is to use my earnings to help purchase my first home, garner more knowledge on stocks etc.

I was looking at, expanding my NVDA, INTC holdings. I’m optimistic on INTC. 

Some others I’ve see a lot on here about is ACHR, LUNR, RKLB, QUBT and DDOG. 22, curious on your takes about my portfolio. My consistent investments have been VTI, COST, and CW. Looking to invest more in UFPI this following year. Still doing research on what else to invest in. 

Some of these investments are from when I was much younger and still learning about stocks; as I've grown older and more knowledgeable, I think I've made better investments.

I bought a spy call at 607 and profited 20 dollars without it hitting 607 or going past it. 

I thought calls only profit if they hit or exceed strike price. 100% s&p 500

thoughts? So.. I've this messy situation. Like, 80% my portfolio is in a retirement account - a basket of ETFs, effectively it's a conservative balanced fund mimicking 40:60 (40% equities, 60% fixed income) allocation. Other 20% is ""play money"" - which, despite what it suggests, I'm **very careful** with. This is roughly equally allotted to:

* ishares semiconductor ETF - gets me a lot of NVDA and other cool $hit
* ishares EU property yield fund
* Rithm Capital - pays me decent 6% post-tax dividend
* Target 
* Schlumberger 
* MSFT 
* Pfizer 
* Taiwan semi
* JPM
* Oracle 

I'm 45F,  single mom, single income, still saving a good portion of it monthly. On Sunday evening, I'm wondering, am I too risk averse? Not planning on going YoLo on RKLB or anything.. but, 

* Q1. should I perhaps step up the gas, and go to 50:50 - from 40:60? 
* Q2. for the ""play money"" part, would you suggest any addition / deletion? 

PS - forgot to mention, 3% of this 20% (0.6% overall), is used for Options a) to hedge, b) to satisfy my FoMo and casino instincts. I don't write options, only buying them to, someday.... hit a jackpot. a 7 figure portfolio

Started making a lot more money after starting my career so just now starting to put some real money into the market and want to learn more about investing. Looking to hold onto stocks long term and learn about different companies on top of investing into etfs. A lot of my early stocks were dividend stocks. How am I doing yall ? And tips for new stocks/companies to invest in would be sweet. Thanks! Hi guys, I haven't traded in the US stock market, but due to the poor performance of my country's stock market in recent years, I am thinking of putting some money into a long-term investment.

I am thinking of investing in these stocks and ETFs:

VOO - for big-cap companies

VB - for small-cap tech companies

BRK - for more traditional companies like Banking?

As I said, I am not familiar with the US market, can you give me some suggestions about my decision and the holding proportion? Listed in order of holding size. Appreciate opinions:
VOO — 20%
MSFT— 15%
AMD — 15%

NBXG I just got out of QQQ and VTI (mostly) to play it a bit safer since I'm retired, and valuations are pretty high. My geographical diversification is 55% US, 15% CAD, 30% global. I'm still in my 40s, so I didn't want to go to bonds for my retirement, since I can rejoin the workforce if shit goes bad (and I'd rather increase my gains more). I don't have any specific questions, but maybe people have some comments. (SGOV is very temporary.)

My goals are long-term growth (15% yearly) and dividends alongside it, and I’m open to constructive criticism.

Thanks for taking a look, and I appreciate any feedback. [removed] 23, started investing in March (primarily in PRSCX, FXAIX, and NVDA), portfolio is a mix of long term mutuals and more volatile short term stocks that I trade daily

  
PRSCX 29.79%, +19.03% return

FXAIX 29.33%, +16.00% return

NVDA 20.11%, +50.82% return

KSCP 12.91%, -14.08% return\*

MSTR 2.42%, +45.33% return

ACHR 1.71%, +2.89% return (just bought today, planning on selling short term)

DECK 1.11%, +33.32% return

LMT .80%, -6.12% return

META .62%, +24.03% return

SNOW .56%, +12.11% return

WDAY .31%, -5.83% return

TXT .31%, -8.52% return

overall return since March 2024 is +17.14%, and until just recently I've only held bought shares and haven't sold any short-term, but I'm looking to start doing more research to buy/sell in shorter time periods.

  
\*planning on holding KSCP til Q3 of this year, they ran a whole corporate restructuring (which gave negative earnings the last year and a half) and relisted themselves after being at risk of delisting from NASDAQ, but I've attended lots of their public shareholder meetings and feel confident about them rising in the year with the number of renewed contracts they received + partnering with Verizon just a week or so ago I have $36k spread amongst 7 companies- AAPL, META, IONQ, RGTI, NVDA, MSFT and AMZN. I am at 91.6% gain (so roughly $19k invested). 
Would I be better off focusing on one high growth potential company? For example, I’m up 95% on NVDA but only have 5 shares…so should I focus more on position size? Goal is $100k next year at this time (I know it’s ambitious, but why not?) I have amazon, Costco, nvidia, micro strategy(selling if it goes up again tomorrows so can break even) small cap ETF Vanguard, etf growth vanguard, schwab u.s. small cap etf. Should I sell any of these and put thag $ into any of my other stocks? Also was thinking about getting Netflix or apple? Any advice? Should I diversify my main investment account? If so, how? It feels very safe right now, but the idea of all my money riding on the wellbeing of a single company scares me. 

AAPL - 1200 shares

NVDA - 5 shares 

Buying power: $9000 I have about 100k invested and am going to add in 25k more soon. What do you recommend I do with it? 

current break down is: 

Random smaller stocks - 11%

AAPL, MSFT, V - 25%

QQQ- 23%

VOO - 30%

VTI -11% Thoughts on this portfolio recommend by AI? hah...

	•	50% U.S. Total Market (VTSAX, FSKAX, VOO)

	•	20% International Stocks (VXUS)

	•	15% U.S. Large-Cap Growth (SCHG or VUG)

	•	10% Sector-specific ETFs (VGT, XLF)

	•	5% Small-Cap Growth (SLYG) Have 800k to play with what should I do. Current holdings : NVDA, AMZN, AVGO, PANW, PLTR Excluding crypto holdings since crypto adds a big outlier:

VWRA: 11.36%

VTI: 6.02%

VOO: 11.37%

QQQ: 26.05%

LULU: 9.88%

LLY: 6.77%

BRK B: 23.13%

ASTS: 4.82%

I feel I'm a little too conservative. Any advice on higher risk/return options?

Including crypto:

VWRA: 7.00%

VTI: 3.83%

VOO: 7.01%

QQQ: 15.30%

LULU: 5.75%

LLY: 3.30%

BRK B: 13.53%

MDXH Personally I like your portfolio, you have clearly done well.  I think there are a lot of people on here that say put it in an index fund and relax and there is nothing wrong with that.  You seem to want to be more active.  My only critique would be that is a lot of stocks to manage.  Personally I would trim it, have some stuff that you don’t have to worry about and then maybe 5 big swings that you can go deep on dad and have a bigger portion dedicated to it. Portfolio for my personal brokerage accounts. Have 401k and and IRAS all in VOO.

Planning to deleverage and sell some CAVA shares once new year starts and put that into my index funds/IRA max the 7k limit ASAP. otherwise. I am planning to increase positions in these stocks next year with exception of NVDA, MSFT unless i find others that interest me.

Bottom 10: https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/s/eDDhggzfdK

Top 8: https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/s/05S0oBhZC9 I like the attitude and at age 54 I also love analyzing individual stocks as a way to expand knowledge and horizon, even though I know there is a likelyhood I willl not beat SP500 long term. Also like the portfolio. Lots of high quality + growth. Some ""financial infrastructure"" like Visa, Moodys etc might be a place to look next? Or maybe some medical devices companies - also a lot of wide moat and high quality to look into there. Keep up the quest for knowledge and good stocks ;-) This is a brag-bot 🤪 No way, 18 y.o. has patience to hold these stocks for over 6 months. I know, I checked prices daily and sold within a month. To many to keep track and up to date. [deleted] May I ask which additions were most recent? (curious what you are buying now) Why PSIX? Good catch early on > Mitsubishi Heavy Industries 

What's the bull case for mitsubishi? Is it just good value or is your thesis based on some geopolitical shifts in its favor (japan allow weapons exports etc)? What's your gold thesis and why? Near term, everyone's quite bearish. The bulls discussing inflationary policy etc. always sound a bit too conspiratorial to me. I love your low cost, underpriced picks, though. I approve of IGIC. It's one of my top 3 insurance picks. What made you choose them? Is the rationale behind NLCP that you’re bullish on the cannabis industry? Or just like the companies financials? Stick to NVDA, don’t get greedy with speculative stocks. NVDA is a proven company with strong cash flows and growth. Odds are they are going to continue beating the market for years to come (less momentum as years progress obviously) Careful regarding QUBT, recent information came out making it a risky play. For quantum computing I would look at RGTI, IONQ or D wave :) No, they profit when the premium price goes up. For a simple directional option, the premium increases as the underlying price approaches the strike. This is equal to the delta minus the time decay. How old are you? If you're under 40, I think you're too conservative. But I have a higher risk tolerance than most. I'd be QQQ under 40, if I wanted to stay in a single ETF. Free money as long as you wait for a long time. It's hard to beat SP500 returns too. I like the high quality mega cap companies that you have. I would caution against SOXX as semiconductors are cyclical. Wall Street might rotate into it but they may rotate OUT and crush you. Not a bad entry point into SOXX right now though. Recommend just concentrating in NVDA. Are there competitors to Square? Is it Stripe? I feel like there are already some big players in the payment handling field, going up against . Are you hoping they get purchased? Seems like a lot of the pie to give to them (maybe I'm wrong, though). Can't go wrong with VOO, and I think Google too. I mean, quite focused on those two companies with a sprinkle of diversification through VOO. If you can stomach a potential downturn on the 7 figure portfolio... :) Here's a breakdown of your mix: [https://insightfol.io/en/portfolios/report/bc3c1b7e31/](https://insightfol.io/en/portfolios/report/bc3c1b7e31/) Why Square? I don’t understand people building portfolios like this of 15 plus stocks… just buy the SP500 man. The probability that you’re going to beat the index exponentially decreases as you add more and more stocks beyond 8-10. Buy the SP500 and 2-3 HIGH CONVICTION plays where you feel there’s alpha. The rest is a waste of time and will likely just lead to you underperforming. I don't think this is bad, but: 1) what is your thesis for an EW turnaround? 2) while I know they're not apples-to-apples, I'd say consider choosing ZTS or IDXX and concentrating in one or the other 3) it's bounced lately, but what's the medium/long-term thesis for PAYC? 4) would rather TMO or RGEN than A but it's not a bad company 5) would actually rather diversified BKNG than ABNB. Very bad selection overall, sorry, just my opinion. Are all your funds parked in these? Or hopefully, just the ""play money""? 


 Sell - Booking, FTNT, Visa (suggesting to book profit, where PE is 30+ with a good run up) 


 Buy - AMD and an index ETF 😂 Bro bought an s&p etf and then decided to buy every stock in the s&p individually Too many ETFs 😭 Stick to 3-4 MAX. VOO + QQQM + AVUV/IWM (small caps) is a good mix Stick to 100% VOO retired??? at 40? if you dont mind me asking, what is the net worth of this portfolio? you would need some capital growth for the next few years? right? unless you are at $5m+ then you could do well. Really solid portfolio actually. Well-diversified. Why the allocation in DIS and Visa? Also, would recommend not investing in AFK and opt for something like INDA (India) now. Africa will definitely have its time, that time just isn’t now. Im not entirely sure on your risk profile but I would do most in VOO/QQQM. If you’re feeling risky throw in more NVDA/GOOGL. SGOV for the safe money. An allocation in AVUV (small caps) for some diversification away from the mega caps. M20 University Student I like these names. Why MA, GS, UNH, and CMG? Just stick to Mag7 and S&P 500. IONQ and RGTI are too speculative for me. Look at valuations for Mag7. Most enticing for me are NVDA (huge growth prospects) and GOOGL (value pick). Meta and Amazon are positioned well too. Also I bought nvda 2 years ago but had to sell it. I know it’s not gonna go up at the rate that it was but it still a good time to buy it? I see AAPL as way overvalued, but that's just me.

I think both META and GOOG are two other Mag 7 stocks that don't seem overvalued. Especially GOOG. Unless you actually believe that Google is about to die like some do, lol

I also own NVDA, but probably wouldn't add to that position unless it dipped below $120. I like this thread. Cool to see how others divy up their funds. I personally have the following:

NVDA
TSLA
RGTI
QBTS
IONQ
AMZN
QTUM

I should probably diversify my sectors, but I'm also rebuilding my account from a $45k loss I took in 2022. Portfolio was literally down 98% on some WsB stuff, but I learned from my mistakes, took a step back, and executed a whole new strategy, and am now only -16% ""all time"". Up 110% over the last 3 months, and 40% for the year, give or take. If it was me, I'd be buying GOOG and AMD. I think both are undervalued at the moment.

I have large positions in both, so take that for what it's worth. I also own NVDA, AVGO, PANW, META, ZS and SYM

I'd also buy more META, but it's not as undervalued as GOOG and AMD.

I'd buy more NVDA if it dipped below $120 somehow. If AVGO has a dip after it's earnings next week, that could be a good opp to get a small AVGO position. They'll be fine long term imo Small cap value > small cap growth I want to add an ETF maybe QQQ or something sector specific. None of the companies should be more than 29% of the portfolio with NVDA being the biggest Why not increasing NVDA and MSFT? And wow you found a lot of winners early on Actually I just have pretty good patience, to sit and watch them grow. Though most of the time I have some cash on hand to buy a little here and there. But most of the stocks are bought with long term hold in mind, with the possibility for a little rebalancing once in a while. I have lots of time, so I would not say around 15 i too bad. That was literally the one thing I said I did not want. I bought MHVFY, WRLGF, AFMJF, and BTAI today, WDOFF and SAND last week. I shaved down APP to 66% of the original stake to reinvest in those companies. Both. The company has excellent growth prospects and poor financial accounting that understates its operating profitability by around 13x. Monetary debasement due to reliance on debt to simulate GDP growth separate from the regular structural drivers, and the international desire to establish mediums of exchange with no counterparty risk. Deflation will create a worldwide crash in asset values of historical proportions as well as a credit crunch that will leave the banking system insolvent, therefore inflationary policies will be pursued instead. This is not a conspiracy - it's the logical conclusion of incentives baked into the cake. Think about why the government, despite claims the U.S. consumer is ""resilient"" and the economy is ""strong"", is deficit spending as if we were in the midst of WWII. Deficit spending is supposed to be countercyclical.

People aren't really thinking about the evolution of monetary institutions in the long-term. They're extrapolating stalled momentum as a thesis. 

Gold's upper price depends on its theoretical function when incorporated into the current monetary order. I've heard estimates ranging from $5000 to $20,000 based on mean reversion to various ratios (gold/Treasury coverage, gold/GDP coverage, etc.).

> I love your low cost, underpriced picks, though.

Thanks. I owe a debt of gratitude to John Hussman's work on long-term portfolio performance for shaping my stock preferences. Both. However, I'm not interested in direct investment: cannabis companies are already struggling to produce appreciable margins since the product is so commoditized. NLCP is my ""picks and shovels"" approach to the industry, one that can consistently produce FCF regardless of tight or loose economic conditions. 

It has stagnated more than I assumed though. Depending on the state of the industry in 2025, I might drop it for another dividend payer with better growth opportunities. Yeah that👆and why would you invest in something you don't understand.  You have to start somewhere to learn, but you should try to learn the basics before losing all of your money to time decay and not understanding why I prefer the lesser known VONG over QQQ. Huh?

Most tech and emerging markets investors I've seen buy 20-30 stocks due to the volality and some losers some winners.

I'm new, explain why that isn't a good idea. Concentration builds wealth, diversification protects it. Never thourght of that. Great advice, thanks! Thanks, very good inputs and questions! 1) EW has re-rated because of a temporary slow down in growth but it is fundamentally a great and profitable company (last 20 + years with stable and high ROIC) and I count on long term secular growth to pick up again from 2026. The huge dip in EW share price was partly because of an overreaction (fear of obesity medicine willl cure heart desease, but I think the opposite will happen -  more people will be able to actually get treatment when they loose weight). 2) ZTS / IDXX: I have held ZTS for a long time and it is a stable core position. IDXX is a recent addition. It has only traded at these multiples very few times since 2017. It has a solid marked position, so I figured it to be a good time to diversify instead of keep adding to ZTS. Both ZTS and IDXX are fundamentally well run businesses with stable/rising margins and I think they are both still here 20 years from now. 3) PAYC (along with BILL) was my play on ""small-cap"". Instead of trying to find a basket of US-small-cap, why not invest on those who will benefit from small-cap taking off? Both have played out almost perfectly in 2024 but even after huge gains, are still trading at reasonable price compared to expected growth. I have worked with HR-software and know exactly how hard it is to switch and I think the PAYC strategy of providing wall-to-wall for smaller companies, has benefits compared to the other vendors in the space (it is tempting for smaller business who have a hard time finding ressources to manage their integrations, but once they are on board, the lock-in is stronger). 4) Good call! I have my eyes on TMO as well - waiting for a price in the 16-18 EV/EBITDA range and may have a critical look at A to find the money. 5) Waiting to see what ABNB will do with their huge war chest ;-) Thanks, considering AMD already. FTNT and BKNG are two of my biggest winners and I could take profit since I agree they have become a bit expensive. I understand my way of investing is peculiar, but I found screening and imaging the futures of companies so interesting. I live pretty frugally and i own my house and car, no dependents. yeah, I want to try and grow what I have so that I can be less careful with my money in later years. My US portion was in VTI and QQQ until very recently, and I moved them to VDC and SGOV. Thanks!

I've been holding Visa for 3 years in my margin account, because I wanted a safe place to put USD, and now that it's grown by about 50%, I don't want to pay taxes on the gains right now (but may take them early next year).

Disney was a purchase I made because I was happy with the company's brands, and felt like their situation was going to improve post-covid, but it hasn't, and now I'm still down 17%. I'm not necessarily opposed to moving that money to something more likely to improve, it's just getting over my irrational dissatisfaction of cementing existing losses.

AFK was a tip from a friend that did not pay off, and I'm kinda just holding the bag in hopes that it improves, so that I feel less bad about it.  (I don't take tips from him anymore, though.) Same with NTR, actually. I was in VTI and QQQM until just recently, and trying to play it a bit safer to ride out the political uncertainty. I plan to get back into those after the next pullback/correction. MA - I believe it has a durable moat.
GS - Bought it back in October 2023 when valuations were at multi year lows.
UNH - Similar to the reason for GS and a durable moat
CMG - Liked the food and the revenue growth:) i’ve got most of my money in FXAIX that loosely tracks the S&P500 but i’m using the smaller amounts to trade for smaller amounts that i can use more often I own it, but wouldn't add to my position unless it's below $120 personally

Might be a good time to buy a little AMD tho, especially if it dips into the high 130's. I think next quarter after the Xilinx amortization is completely done with, the P/E is going to look WAY cheaper, which should cause retail buyers to pile in.

Institutions already realize the Xilinx amortization scenario I bought more NVDA today. They're years ahead of AMD. You are not probably doing thorough analyses and DD at more than 10 but just going with flow and got luck reading news articles. 

But Congratulations and hope you luck still runs good. Don’t let others discourage you. This is a great starting portfolio and 15 stocks is a good amount. My only recommendation is diversification, you’re very tech heavy.

You have many blue chip stocks in your portfolio that doesn’t require daily tracking. You’re also not a day trader, you literally can literally just buy and forget. I mean no one’s gonna sit there and research Procter and Gamble (PG) every week. [deleted] How long do you plan on holding MHVFY. Bought in a few weeks ago as well. Do you have a specific price target/fair value? I'm always a bit wary of japanese companies as they have a history of bad governance (keiretsu, cash hoarding, bad handling of small shareholders etc). Even if it looks cheap sometimes you just don't get the value unlocked. Then on the other hand I see the company is mooning since 2024 and japan is pushing for corporate reforms so there is a chance. If you concentrate your portfolio into fewer stocks you have a higher risk but also get higher returns.

Ex. If i bought nvidia pre split at 500$ a share ($50 equivalent in post split), and i bought 1k of it (2 shares pre split, 20 now), id now have $1740 in return. If i did the same with the s&p or an index id have less. If i made my own index with >15 stocks and the other stocks didnt perform as well (which is likely) id be losing out on profits

Keep in mind, the example is a bad idea too, you shouldnt only own 1 stock, just explaining the concept with a slight hyperbole Understandable. Not hating just having a laugh Haha hope you’re still friends with that friend, he’s only trying to help. I would stay overweight on U.S. equities, and would only consider emerging/developed markets if the U.S. economy/market weakens. That said, the world shakes when the U.S. sneezes. Africa will have its time but that’s decades away. And also, just because the economy of a country improves significantly, doesn’t mean you’ll be able to capture the gain through the public markets. SSE Composite Index (Shanghai) is only up 380% all time, dating back to 1995. Chinese people got wealthy through real estate, not stock. For individual investors, for the long term, I would highly consider the Magnificent 7 stocks (Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Meta, Google, Amazon, Tesla). They all have a CAGR that is higher than the S&P 500 the past decade. ANY percentage higher that you can get more than the market is extremely valuable, as those returns will compound over time. 

When Apple became the most valuable company in the world in 2012, and you invested in 100k in it, you would have $965,552 today versus $346,234. Apple’s CAGR is 25.69% and S&P 500 is 13.34%. Sometimes the best way to make money is right in front of you. Most people don’t realize that. Most people are underinvested in Nvidia. They think that Nvidia is too expensive and that the train already passed. Sure the best momentum has passed, but the growth is still getting started.

These companies have such strong economic moats, and people underestimate their globalization effects (everyone and their mom is using American technology). These will only compound.

Short term these stocks are definitely volatile but with a buy and hold strategy, you should outperform the market over an extended period unless a huge disruption takes market share. My picks for today are something like (50% NVDA, 30% GOOGL, 10% AMZN, 10% META). TSLA/AAPL/MSFT don’t have attractive valuations for me at the moment It may take longer than you anticipate for a pullback to occur. It takes humility in saying that you don’t know when the next pullback will happen. Best to stay invested. If you have cash when pullback happens, add then. I'm more interested in future growth.

Really, really hard for NVDA to double from here. AMD, different story.

I own both. I am doing analysis and DD, but ofc not every day for every company. Daily I’m just looking at news, with a deeper dig every quarter or if some big news comes. 

These are positions built over a year, not all bought in the same day. So I have had pelts of time to choose. Thanks man.  I am pretty tech heavy, but on other hand I personally think that the tech stocks that I have are still at a pretty fair valuation and I believe in their continued growth in the future. But I am definitely also looking to add more outside tech. 

I like the mix of blue chip stocks that i feel can still outperform the market as a base, and some smaller stocks as potential high flyers. This also leaves me some more time to really lean about the smaller companies, as I can look at the blue chips once in a while and judge if my investment case still stands. While on the other hand the smaller stocks are more “engaging”, and you can’t just be passive. 

Procter and Gamble i have as my ultra safe stock, which makes the red days a tiny bit better while it has still performed pretty decently. I think it’s better to take risk earlier in life, my time horizon i longer and it’s not gonna impact me if I loose 40% like it would if I had a house and family. And yes I did start in a bull market, but I would not bring It all down to just luck. I am lucky to be surrounded by people who have great knowledge about stocks who have also helped me learn. 
Even if you take the outliers, worst and best performer out i would have still outperformed. I like that I can take a higher risk than if I bought and index, even though that probably will lead to underperformance i bear markets, it will hopefully lead to outperformance in bull markets. Long-term, I expect it to double at minimum. It's expensive according to as-reported metrics (~31x P/E). I'm saying it's a lot less expensive than what those suggest. MHVFY's real P/E is around 6x. Sure, but my strategy is more akin to buying multiple lottery tickets, somewhat more like investing in startups, but I guess I should put more into Rheinmetal etc. So, do you think it is the best solution to sell off all individuals and buy some ETFs? (or TB, in case the market falls) > Africa will have its time but that’s decades away. And also, just because the economy of a country improves significantly, doesn’t mean you’ll be able to capture the gain through the public markets.

Yeah, I think this was the mistake made. Other countries are investing in Africa, but those profits are not going to the companies there. Thanks, I appreciate you spending time reviewing and giving advice. How do you come to conclusions like 30% google, but 10% amazon? Is it just confidence level? Why is AMD a different story..? NVDA has taken the lion’s share for a reason..? Despite AMD being a smaller company doesn’t mean they are entitled to a greater market share I agree with this strategy. Be more aggressive early in life and transition to ETFs later in life after you've built a significant nest egg. Just be sure to diversify. I lost six figures in my twenties (401k) when the tech bubble burst. It was a fun ride on the way up but took 10+ years to recover. [deleted] Also I noticed there’s multiple related tickers. Do you by chance know what MHVYF and MHVIY are? If you're trying to establish a stake in convexity setups, then your allocation needs to be weighted to reflect the risk/reward tradeoff. The principal distribution feels very random. If I knew the best solution I'd be doing it. Personally, I'd stick to 1-3 ETFs for at least 80% of the portfolio. Playing with the other 80% is fine but I wouldn't waste time having less than, say, a thousand bucks in a company. Anything less and even if it doubles you're not seeing much of a gain Gotcha. U.S. equities remain superior above any other stock market in the world. Of course! Google is undervalued compared to its Mag7 counterparts. Once DOJ antitrust case is over, it's gonna pop. Trailing 12 months P/E ratio is 22.4. Amazon has high growth prospects, so does Meta and especially Nvidia. These stocks are magnificent for a reason. TSLA can also produce great returns (second best Mag7 performer behind Nvidia this decade) but it is highly speculative. It is trading far above its fundamentals. I don't fully understand it but that's investor sentiment for you. Nvidia is a 3.5 trillion dollar company. For them to double, they'd have to be worth 7 TRILLION, lol..

I'm not saying there's never going to be a 7 trillion dollar company, but we've NEVER had a 4 trillion dollar company. I think NVDA is actually going to be the first to 4 trillion, and that's why I continue to hold my shares. However, them going all the way to 7 trillion is pretty far fetched. Maybe in 5 years.

AMD on the other hand is 225 billion. For them to double, they'd have to go 450 billion.

To me, I think it's a lot easier for AMD to double up than NVDA.

AMD's current P/E is 121 but it's forward P/E is only 27 or 28. I think the reason it's so much lower is because the Xilinx acquisition of a number of years ago is still affecting the books, which affects their P/E. AMD has had a distorted P/E ever since late 2021 due to the amortization of that acquisition. I believe that after next quarter, the acquisition will have fully digested and the P/E will look WAY more reasonable. [removed] MHVIY looks like an unsponsored ADS. MHVYF is probably the ADR. I do put in different amounts depending on risk and my belief in them, so i have Jumia for a small sum and Rheinmetal for more Thank you for your reply. At first I bought individuals with a quarter of my cash (the rest went into ETFs). But thanks to the rising market, my portfolio was distorted. I know I should follow your advice, but I want to gain experience and knowledge of the market rather than profit. Fortunately, even if I invest 80% of my money exposed to the market, there will be more than $10,000 left. Then I would like to get ideas on how to improve my portfolio.

  
I've already decided to sell what we call meme stocks, but there will be more than 40 brands. That's what I feel it problematic. Is there really a strong demand for AMD’s chips though? A tier below Nvidia? Why would top echelon companies want to purchase AMD if it’s not the best option? They need the best in the industry if they want to beat their competition A few years ago a trillion dollar company sounded absurd… In a few years 10 trillion dollar companies are the norm [deleted] Gotcha thanks. What brokerage do you use if you don’t mind me asking? Yeah that's fair. Also remember you can paper trade and that way your money isn't at risk and your learning experiences don't potentially push back your retirement. 

You could always look for exits in the ones you aren't as optimistic about anymore. I personally cap the total number of stocks in my portfolio to about 10 but it's flexible. Try to avoid developing an emotional attachment to any of them. If you had to rank them right now, the bottom 20 should be easy sells sometime in the next year. From there you can take time to really do you due diligence on the remaining ones and rebalance as needed Why comment something that does not matter? I asked for opinions on my portifolio, and now you start to generalize, why comment if you have nothing meaningful to say about what I ask? E-Trade.

"/r/Stocks Weekend Discussion Saturday - Dec 07, 2024","$200k call order for Planet Labs at $5 strike, 1/17 expiration, came in this Tuesday. The premiums show market makers expect a move of $0.69 higher or lower after Monday earnings, and $1.86 higher or lower by expiration. 

There's a fair chance the buyer is looking to soak up appreciation from IV growth right before the end of the day. On the other hand, $200k is massive for a stock with this little share + options volume. As a speculative play, don't dedicate much to this. If you take it up, watch the open interest before close and be ready to duck out if the buyer exits early. I just had this happen with FL and it presaged the terrible earnings report.

EDIT: If you want to sell a weekend iron butterfly, the iShares iBoxx $ High Yield Corporate Bond ETF (HYG) has been one of the best candidates since September. Looks like the [Syrian government just collapsed](https://apnews.com/article/syria-assad-sweida-daraa-homs-hts-qatar-7f65823bbf0a7bd331109e8dff419430?taid=67551c9445ae040001ae4f9e&utm_campaign=TrueAnthem&utm_medium=AP&utm_source=Twitter). This is no doubt going to affect the entire region, if not the world one way or another. Is there any reason to sell NVDA? I've went all in a few years ago and just held on to it. It is now 60% or my portfolio with the rest of it on SPY and other stocks.

I feel like this is too much into one stock, but each time I thought about selling over the years, it just keeps going up. What are some good companies to buy puts on when this thing pops? Just spy? Anything particularly infladed? Nvda, pltr? My dream would be for the market to keep melting up until Netflix earnings and play puts on Netflix. $BIOA Phase 2 trials cancelled, sucking up about a 70% loss right now, praying the stock goes back up in a year or two.. maybe too optimistic When is AMD a buy? It's been a brutal year even though it had two strong earnings and one slightly shaky earnings. Down ytd even though other tickers are flying. Anyone heard of or looked into HRMY(Harmony Biosciences)?

Fundamentals look extremely strong Anyone have thoughts on UNH and insurers in general? I feel like a 11% dip over the last week is bit extreme and bakes in a high chance there is regulation or change in denial practices that impacts profitability. Not sure the Trump adminstration/Congress will force that change and doubt businesses and consumers choose with anything more than what gives them the lowest premiums. 

Thoughts? Since this is a stocks subreddit I'd say it's a nothingburger. BTC didn't even flinch. I like selling covered calls at a strike price I'd willing to sell at and then reduce my exposure that way. I think it's a great stock to own, but it's become a 35% of my portfolio and want to practice better diversification. You don’t have to sell all of it.  Just park it back to a percentage you’re more comfortable with Do some collars QQQ PLTR is egregiously overvalued. Will fall a ton once the bubble bursts. A P/S ratio of 69? Get real. Go after the ones that aren't viable businesses like the flying car bs. Those r ripe for being quantumscaped. That's why I don't do biotechnology small caps If it breaks below its 130 support then I will be interested. Might have had a mediocre year but still had a amazing 5 year run. It's a turd, nvda monopoly on ai chips is unbreakable. Without AI amd is just Playstation and Lenovos Yes, it's a great company. I used to own shares, but the sensitivity of the stock price to sentiment made me bail. It would go up and down based off everything except actual milestones and performance. Maybe I'll reenter if the health care sector picks up again. Having millions of people around the world celebrate the death of your ceo while bringing to light a lot of the heinous shit UNH has done is really bad PR. Possible that people switch off UNH when insurance renewal comes around. Also possible that this leads to further turmoil for the industry down the road. Either way im not interest in UNH at these prices Total nothingburger. Sqqq calls vs puts on qqq? Never really understood the difference There's companies with no sales at all Learned my lesson real quick yesterday, I'll be sticking to S&P for the foreseeable 😬 It's tough, even with a basket of them. I've basically made no money on them after 3.5 years of holding. Better than losing money, but brutal opportunity cost considering how the rest of the market has run. Bid ask and volume gonna be higher for qqq options.

"Playing the TikTok possible ban (META, SNAP, GOOG) ","I think tik tok will appeal all the way to the Supreme Court  Snap is still a thing? Social professional here - Meta and Google would be the wave. IG Reels and YT Shorts are the two most similar spots to TikTok, I have no idea how much of the TT only users would actually migrate but plenty of people on TT are already using IG and YT in some capacity. 

Snap is such a different type of platform, they might get a bump on the news itself but my team doesn’t really use the platform whatsoever for social content, and we market on TT a ton. We’re already pretty active on YT Shorts and IG. Think that’s where the focus would go Wouldn't count on tik tok ban but META was setup for a run even before this court news. Analysts just upped their targets to mid-600s to low 700s. This is one of the best breakout setups yet RSI isn't yet overbought. META is the direct competitor to tik tok and Instagram reels at this point is just a clone of tik tok. Many tik tok users have instagram accounts and many of the content are practically the same, so they will see the most uptick in traffic.

Youtube also wins as it solidifys itself as the winner in longer duration content videos something that tik tok is trying to compete with them.

Snap will just continue to be dogshit lol Just go RDDT The trouble with playing it with GOOG/GOOGL is the fact they have so much DOJ overhang.

Look at the announcements of Waymo this week.   It crushed Uber and Lyft but barely moved GOOG/GOOGL.

Same with Google claiming the top spot across the board with LLMs.   They are now #1 in every category and then offer a 2 meg context window in addition. All under the guise of security .. meanwhile homes all across the USA have IOT devices connected to cloud servers in China ... RDDT Just like Bluesky taking off in response to Musk fucking up Twitter, you should not limit yourself to pre-existing platforms that failed to capture that audience because their product is not what the TikTok audience is looking for.  

You should be watching out for new competitors not constrained by their existing entrenched corporate politics and investors that affect these existing products from Meta, etc. They're not likely to flourish anymore than when TikTok first launched. You should keep an eye out for something new to take its place. These larger tech companies already failed to create this product before TikTok did, despite having previous dominance in the market. All meta did for example was copy it at a surface level with short form videos and navigation, but missed the entire point of why the TikTok algorithms work so well. Meta et Al aren't going to suddenly pull it off if they haven't already (they still haven't) just because TikTok gets banned, if it does.  
 
But sure, you do you. Should be headed to the Supreme Court, right?

In any case, Mary Anne Conway is lobbying against the ban, so who knows where we land on this. Lol it's not getting banned $RDDT

It’s so obvious…

Edit: “I should have bought Reddit stock in 2024. I used it every day” - you guys in the future There are so many issues facing social media. Regulation and the increasing AI flood.

I wouldn’t touch any of them based on that my bets on Meta, yt is good but ig is much better in terms of sharing the content. Our youth may have a chance now Will RDDT benefit, making the market cap go up to $100 billion? I think, if TikTok is banned, many people will blame these big companies, and so there might be a boycott.  
They might use [Vidzy](https://vidzy.codeberg.page/) instead, because no-one makes money off it, and they don't want to reward the people who passed these policies.  
But I don't think Trump will ban TikTok. RDDT will benefit as well YouTube shorts is pretty close to tiktok, plus you get YouTube too Priced in Rumble It's not getting banned. Trump doesn't want it banned. People have to realise TT being banned is absolutely irrelevant- anyone with a brain cell knows how to use a VPN! TT being banned will have zero effect on the stock market! [deleted] I just have a feeling that Trump will reverse the ban. Just my intuition. They will, but as many legal scholars have opined, there is no guarantee the Supreme Court will take up the case at all. I actually use it and even I'm surprised to see it in this list My understanding is that Reels has far superior reach to YT Shorts and Snap Spotlight. Is this a correct analysis? I also wonder how much Meta is going to clamp down on organic reach if their chief competitor is no more. They can really hammer the pay to play angle with TikTok out of the picture. For content creators, TikTok remains popular not only because of reach but because of payouts. I don't think IG pays creators very well but reels can be simultaneously pushed to Facebook pages which do. Most of them are available on all TT & IG. YT is not widely adopted by celebrities. Memes and other stuff do exist on YT Meta all the way. TikTok people may use YouTube at times but nobody (litterary) watches YouTube shorts except for people who absolutely hate TikTok because it's cool.



Meta was big before TikTok and it would survive after. YouTube? It's an add riddled hellhole of curated propaganda, lies and nonsense. And a few usable videos but litterary nothing cool or hip. *TikTok is free and limited ads, YouTube is expensive or filled with so many ads old network TV is ashamed* META is likely target of new DoJ investigations as Trump has big tech in his crosshairs. And, they're at all time highs already. Otherwise, I agree, they are likely the best beneficiary in the long run. Meta is better for several reasons, also because they do well in AI and they have a founder still in charge.

Google is dead man walking, as I've repeatedly told people, but which most of you don't seem to agree with. Youtube is something that would just stay forever. YT is probably the only one which had the greatest first-mover advantage. 
Content producers can't get users onto a new platform. Hence, no reward.
No content on other platforms, no users.
No users on other platforms, no advertisers.

Things are too good for YT.
Long live YT Bullish why not? “Obvious” yeah bro I’m sure all the short form video content creators will migrate to a text based platform en masse Reddit, where a lot of content on the front page comes from TikTok 💀 My god the top is so in Be serious Yeah honestly 😂😂 Trump is known to flip flop on policy all the time so we will see. You over estimate the people with brain cells No one is going to bother using VPN for TikTok (or any app/website) in the US. 

Not only will your experience be degraded, a lot/most of your friends won’t be using VPN and the content you enjoyed will not be there, anymore. 

Add in that VPN costs money and a lot of consumers, especially teenagers, are misers. That's really not close enough to be effective. The problem isn't just getting TikTok, it's also that you need the users. Even if half are willing to use a VPN to get TikTok to work (which is extremely generous), you're still losing half of the user base and that is essentially giving market share to Instagram. > anyone with a brain cell knows how to use a VPN

I'm very interested in this because we're considering onboarding a VPN company as a client. Do you have any sources to back up this claim? Not doubting you as I think your analysis here is spot on. But I might need some research/articles to bring this to my coworkers on Monday. Paul plays deep ITM leaps on great stock. No shit he makes money. This comment is so irrelevant and parroted around as if every other congressperson doesn't trade stocks too how do i follow her trades? [deleted] Not to mention that the bill had bipartisan support in congress. Even though Trump has said he’s against banning it, it’s not a foregone conclusion this court would go a certain way on it Nor is there any guarantee they won’t just do whatever Trump wants There is no guarantee the Supreme Court will take any case. The SC is the only court in the country that can choose its own docket. Yep especially with how conservative they’ve been IG has better reach for sure, YT Shorts can do numbers though. I’m not super familiar with Snap Spotlight

I don’t think clamping organic would be the right play - they would need to get the TT influencers to be active on IG, and those people need organic reach Til Tok ban is also good for google search Instagram doesn't pay at all. It's exclusively 3rd party pay outs last I knew. Facebook used to pay awesome but has gradually declined as they’ve opened up their monetization programs to accounts with as low as 100 followers. New monetization program starts in January I believe so will see how that goes. Our in stream ads currently pay waaaaaay better then reel views but you get more reach via reels most of the time. Yeah, but TT is not a celeb driven platform imo. Influencers sure, but they’d be savvy enough to get on YT in this type of scenario Every other video on tt is an ad. Or a tik tok shop or sponsored content we shall find out soon. I feel like new FCC won't go after big tech as much as Leena Khan did. The VP is literally owned by the first investor in Facebook...... Ha.  The only things in those cross-hairs are the companies his new owners - Musk and Thiel - want taken down a notch. Zuckerberg has bent the knee. Apple will buy it The thing is at one point I remember Reddit having a “shorts/reels” section but they killed it. Does anyone know why? Try “Popular” instead of “Home”, and while you’re there look at “Watch” Yea that’s true Trump is like the Joker of politics at this point lmao

Totally unpredictable Why hidy! Sorry what are you wanting a source for? Having a brain cell to use a VPN? Step 1 download one of a thousand FREE VPNs out there, step 2 sign up for an account, step 3 activate and turn on- not much more to it!

On a side note- I think companies with VPNs will absolutely sky rocket if this TT ban comes into place! So he spends big money to get money? That i dont know but im sure its online somewhere It's not that. Its that she doesnt even do the most insider trading in congress. Shes done 8 trades in the past year, and Josh Gottheimer has done 546 trades, and has made 53 million dollars more than pelosi. You cleary just wanted to take a shot at her, which is fair. But shes not even the biggest offender in congress. She became a punching bag for insider trading, all while ignoring the other biggest offenders.

  
Source: [https://www.quiverquant.com/congresstrading/](https://www.quiverquant.com/congresstrading/) > bill had bipartisan support in congress

It's one thing to see support on both sides. 

But I believe I read it in Barron's, that they supported the bill after they reviewed classified documents that got them to support it. 

I wonder what they saw. Was that bipartisan support before or after TikTok started pushing ultra right wing content nonstop? I don't think liberal vs conservative has anything to do with it, tiktok ban has complete bipartisan support. The third party pays the bonuses? Or are you referring to just ads via third party paying to be featured on a page? I meant more like influencers, low key influencers have become celebrities now and Trump is own by Musk.  The old PayPal Mafia is bigger than US Steel ""Literally""?

Have you seen the title deed? For real. Billionaire boys club serving up hot dishes of self interest. Yeah because the Chinese government would definitely allow that to happen lmao Probably costs if I had to guess. A 10 second video takes up as much storage as thousands of posts (and that’s probably an underestimate). TikTok has one of the largest data center fleets in the world even though active users are in the same ballpark as Reddit Go to your home on the App, then select “Watch” >download one of a thousand FREE VPNs out there

Do you think some TikTok users would be willing to pay for a VPN? (Like Nord?) Yes. If you buy deep ITM call for jan 2026 on Meta GOOGL nvidia AVGO Right now, I Guess you’ll make money. Yeah but she is a more important figure than Josh Gottheimer so it makes sense why people would put a bigger light on her. ""Congress person, an adversary foreign government knows the physical location, communication habits, personal preferences and has the ability to update and run software on personal devices, on half of the American population which would include government and military personnel"" 

congressman: ""What's that mean?"" 

CIA: ""The Chinese can see and do anything on any phone with tiktok installed"" Sounds like bullshit. 

If that were the reason then they should close the loopholes with robust digital privacy protections so that others can't do the same shit. 

Instead, they just close this door while ten more open The decision to uphold the ban was also joined by an Obama appointee. Instagram doesn't pay you.

Sponsors and other entities do.

Pre much all social media apps stopped paying besides tiktok and YouTube. Apple is the US company with best Chinese relationship. Tim Cook is most of his time there praising the government. Look it up.

I do not know how to make money if this happens lol. Maybe Apple will go down a lot if announced and then I could add some shares Oh shit it’s on a drop down menu !! Thanks man! I used to see it . Not there on my iPhone .. is it an option maybe  ? Yes, of course- the free part I was referring to was targeted at TT’s large user demographic (teenagers) who can’t afford to pay for it. It's mainly right wingers trying to dunk on people. The people who mention pelosi never mention all the right wing people doing the exact same shit. Too much allegiance people have with politicians. They're all crooks. The others make them money and won't give the info to countries we may end up in a war with.   There is zero incentive for them to enact digital privacy laws beyond helping the American people, and most have that low on their priority list. That's great thanks! I don’t doubt it but you can’t argue why people are putting Pelosi more so in the spotlight when the only other example you can give for comparison is a random middle of nowhere congressman for a district in New Jersey while the other was literally the Speaker of the House who was talking to the President and top people in the government everyday. I did not even know who that guy was until I looked him up but everyone will know who Nancy Pelosi is. 

Also that the Josh guy who was used for an example is a Democrat not a Republican. I am not saying you’re wrong but if you’re going to play the both sides argument I would try to use an example from the other side. That's a fair point about pointing out both sides. I posted the link earlier so people could see. Also, if she was truly just doing a bunch of insider trading, she would have significantly more trades than just 8. Every Congress person sits on various committees that oversee certain sectors. My original point still stands. There are far more egregious traders in Congress, and the right likes to use her name. The same way they cheered when her husband was attacked by a guy with a hammer. Unfortunately it's the internet, and nuance doesn't really exist here. Maybe there is but my point is that as far as I am aware the ones that are doing more trading than her are in much lower positions of power. As I said she was the Speaker of the House so it makes sense why people would point her out more so than a random congress person for some random district. When you’re in the spotlight the most people tend to put a bigger microscope on you especially in the world of politics where things are more polarizing. 

I quite frankly don’t really care because insider trading exists whether we like or not and there is nothing we can do about it. Thats just the reality.",playing tiktok possible ban meta snap goog,think tik tok appeal way supreme court snap still thing social professional meta google would wave ig reels yt shorts two similar

When do you take the money?,"If you’re asking on Reddit, it’s probably a good time. You do not have to sell it all.  You could sell 5/6 of it and keep your original amount invested.  Stocks don’t have to be all or nothing Between the two worst-case scenarios (sell and it moons, hold and it tanks), it’s better to have FOMO with profit than misery without profit.

I’d sell a good chunk of it and distribute elsewhere. Keep a portion in case it continues to run. When I’m up big I shave 10-15% every milestone. 

Let’s say I had 100 share at $30. 
$3000 investment. 

Once it hit $50, I sold 10. Now it’s worth $5000. $4500 in brokerage (90 shared left), $500 in cash. 

At $60, I sold 10. Now it’s worth $5900. 
$4800 in brokerage (80 shares), $1100 in cash. 

At $70, I sold 10. Now it’s with $6700. 
$4900 in brokerage (70 shares), $1800 in cash. 

I take the money from the gains ($1800) and reinvest in VOO and QQQ. I sell my stocks when they are up. I never sell my VOO or QQQ. 

Now I have less risk on my first investment and am better balanced for my overall portfolio. Bought at 27 a few years ago. Sold exactly half of it recently. Letting the rest run. I just set up a roughly 10% stop loss and as the price of the stock creeps up, I changed my stop loss to creep up. If the stock goes down and my stop loss is hit then I made a bunch of money and it was meant to be. If it drops and hits the stop loss and then it climbs back up then I can’t say that I messed up because I still made a bunch of money and would’ve could’ve should’ve can’t be part of the equation. Some say that you could take back the invested capital and let the rest of the position run free. My rule: You sell if 1) you need the capital to invest in something cheaper elsewhere or 2) your idea for the company has changed and you believe they won’t grow anymore.

If you take 1), you sell partially, exactly for the cash you need. It can be 10%, what you invested or all, if that’s what you want.

However, the important thing here is that if you buy with an investment mindset, make sure your exit strategy does not come from a trading strategy. It happened to me: buy a company that I believe cheap, hold during -50% losses, finally get after years 100% profit and sell all just for the sake of make profit, although the company kept looking amazing. Later on it went up 200%. Just don’t mix strategies. Sell 20k and hold the rest Do you believe in the company? Then stay invested. SP500 doubles in value  every 7-10 years, and often today’s all time high is the lowest it will ever be ever again.  A great company will perform even better. So if Palantir is now great, keep it. If not, sell. Or diversify. Take half and decide on the rest later. Lock in some profit. You gotta decide would you rather try and make the most money possible, or will you be happy making substantial gain even if you could have made more? I’ve personally started hedging some of my positions with sizable gains and locking in some profits If you see a better opportunity elsewhere sell.  I bought Nvidia and it appreciated by a lot. I took out the initial investment and doubled it and used it to pay off the new car. Depends on your age. How old are you? If you are not close to 65/retirement yet, then don’t sell. Let it ride. Personally I don’t like more than 5% of my portfolio in any single asset, and that’s my threshold to trim.. That being said people have a tendency to sell their winners to “lock in gains” and keep their losers to “break even” when in reality most people should just sell the losers and keep their winners. If you knew exactly when to buy and sell you’d be on an island somewhere. The best advice is always to DCA into a position and then DCA out. Sell some % now. Set up sell orders of X% every few dollars or whatever you’re comfortable with. Set up stop loss to protect some on the way down. Everyone selling PLTR is going to be really sad when they realize the military industrial complex is going to pump PLTR for the next couple decades. You think the Generals, congressmen, Senators, and contractors will let PLTR fall? Its not even 4x listing price. Apple is what, 18,000%? Lmaooo. If you’re selling PLTR, you must really trust the government and think that they have your best interest at heart always. They’re going to keep getting fat fucking contracts for eternity just like Boeing, Oshkosh, Lockheed, etc. Especially with warfare moving from foot soldiers to long range missiles and airspace tech. PLTR will dominate the military industrial complex. And even if it doesnt, it will get fat checks every year. If you're questioning it, then it's probably good to take some risk off. At least take your principle back and use house money If you're content with the gains then sell to break even and see where the rest goes. 

Otherwise just cash out and enjoy the spoils. I've been reading all the comments. Smart people. Take your principal out and let the house money run. If that other guy that thinks it's only getting starting is right you'll be sitting pretty either way. You could sell enough to return your original investment and pay taxes on it, maybe even to have some gains like 10-20% and keep the rest.


Let your winners run and all that. Take ur initial and some money your happy with and let the rest ride


Or cash out If you're not sure just buy puts with the break even at a price you'd want to lock your profits at. That way you sleep peacefully at night and also not miss out on more gains. The key phrase in your post is “a good sized portion of my entire brokerage account.” That’s scary. It’s a given we can’t predict the future of the market, but does the valuation at this share price support placing such a big chunk of your financial future in it? I’d recommend rebalancing your portfolio to spread the risk. You can choose to retain some shares, but move some of your gains into safer harbors. Sell and do what where would you reallocate? I'd sell covered calls against half of your position. It's a bearish position and gives you premium. If your shares are called away, you secured the profit anyway If I have a good run on a stock, I will sell off  half and invest in something else and still keep 50% in the original buy. It doesn't matter what your profit is for a specific stock. You should decide how much to invest and how to allocate based on your conviction. That's it, except that paying capital gains tax sucks. So don't sell your winners unless you think they are over valued. It's pretty obvious shorts are stuck on this ticker. Same thing happened with SMCI and look at what happened. I'm not saying the exact same scenario will happen to PLTR, but it is just another typical hype train with short sellers trapped. Above $70 is definitely an excellent price tag to take profit. Let the rest ride for that $100 touchdown. Congrats for having hold and been on the right side of the fence! Good luck! More money has been lost selling than holding. My philosophy is to never sell assets. I think it’s just getting started personally. I feel that $100 is on the way. I did this with NVDA when it got to $120 a few years ago. It got to $120, Citron came in and said some stuff about it being a casino, which caused it to drop to about $100. I sold, then watched it trickle back up, and up, and then I finally bought back in. PLTR is starting to get some catalysts to boost it up. It’s time. Great job by the way. Not many take profits Have an exit strategy that you determined yourself. Just as an example: 25% @ $XXX, 25% @ $XXX, 15% @ $XXX and so forth til u get to 100% or save some % for long-term. In my opinion, and my opinion only, with Trump in office and what Plantir is doing with the company. Personally, I am holding my til 2025 and taking some profits to buy something nice for myself. The rest would be 2-3 more years minimum. Good luck! The best general advice is to have an exit plan in mind before you buy I sold all my PLTR. It had a great run, booked profits. Happy to buy back on any dip and to keep cash for other opportunities Get the original investment back and a little extra to treat yourself something nice. Just peel some off periodically… every few weeks sell some shares. If it keeps running, you keep peeling, and if it ever crashes you’ve pulled out a good bit of value and (hopefully) bought something else that’s going up in value. I like to do this and just buy cap weight or now equal weight index funds with it. Some people take out the original investment, let the profit run . 
This way you are playing with house,s money and move your money into another stock. 
This way your portfolio diversifies If you still believe in the company, sell 50% and let the rest ride. Or 75% or whatever. Make your extra winnings on the house. (NFA) Depends, did you lose $15k on BKSY, lose $20k on PSFE and lose $10k on GENI, then make all your loses back and have no tax burden? What’s your other stock allocations? Everyone has a different situations and allocations of risk… but what I can say is, you always want to make sure you keep $20-$30k safe in case all hell breaks loose. Current gains or losses have no impact on when you should sell. Do you expect it to outpace the market going forward? Keep it. If not, sell. If you sold and reinvested in a stable ticker like SPY or VOO it would keep generating returns! I like to have a pragmatic approach, sell some, keep some, monthly routine buys (DCA), and monthly allocation to cash pile for opportunity. For example, I auto buy $300/ mo palantir in my brokerage, I auto allocate $500/mo to cash pile, and I max my IRAs. 

You have doubled your money, take some profit, keep it as cash, if you look at the 5y stock chart it is irrationalexuberance, it will retrace for factors that dont change the overall thesis. I love palantir more than any other stock, but I have taken profits in my brokerage. My roth IRAs have palantir in them (wife and I) i have not sold any of those. They are long term holds. You’re up over 100%, you can pull out the original investment and retain exposure to further upside.  The problem is taxes, if you have another stock you can book a loss on for the same year that would be ideal. I trim my position down to my desired portfolio %, and invest in something else I think will grow more from here. sell half keep the rest Lets see i bought amd at 6 and sold at 45 and now it's in the 100s. But I also bought snap at 15 held to 80 and now it's 12.  So who knows. Selling half is not a bad strategy when you’re feeling uncomfortable. Cash out. I’m sure you’ll be able to buy near that price at some point in the future but not sure it’ll ever get back to $70+ Typically, I take my original investment dollars out the table and let it ride.  It the ride continues to increase, I sell a portion for additional profit. Yesterday You can take the middle road. Keep a small portion and sell calls on the rest. Just take your initial investment out.
And let the other 19k€ do there thing.
Don’t get greedy. Btw i have a huge respect for you that you hold all that time: when Palantir went up to €36 and after that it drop way down to 5€. Thank god its 72€ now. But just take some profit mate 🙂 Surprised more people haven’t suggested stop losses I'd sell if you'd feel regret for not doing so if it dips. I wouldn't sell all of it, but I'd use it as a source of capital to diversify or rebalance your portfolio.

Another option I've used in the past is just to pull out all of the principle investment and a little less of the profit, and wait and see what it does for a while. Take some gains! I would sellit and never look back. Yeah could go to 100, blah blah. Who cares. All stocks exist before you buy and after you sell them. The trader can teach the long term investor and vice veraa Depends on profit margin. Any high volatile stocks I’ll ride the profits. Mag 7 rarely if ever. Been trying to Palantir but it keeps climbing 😂 Set up a plan to exit whenever you feel comfortable, and stick to that plan. 

It doesn't have to be your entire position, you can have a plan to sell 60%, 50%, however much you feel comfortable with.

5% every month over the next 12 months, for example. DCA out slowly I’ve got like 200% on nvidia. If I cash out…taxes. If I let it keep going for 20 years… taxes only when cashing out. I’d sell now. It’s overvalued af. When I need to spend it. Otherwise I keep it in and rotate sectors as I see the world shifting. I also bought PLTR very early on. ~$20k at around $17 cost basis. I bought because I'm very familiar with PLTR, did some work that was ultimately incorporated into Gotham when I was at the FBI. Use it in my current industry (utilites) and generally love the platform. 

I sold most everything at around $66. Sucks seeing the run up keep going without me but at the end of the day you should sell when your original thesis doesn't make sense. 

As much as I like and belive in PLTRs product, it's still a SaaS company, and a somewhat niche/expensive one at that. It's still has to grow like a SaaS company. It's market cap has eclipsed other powerhouses in the segment as of late. And that just doesn't make sense to me. 

I think somewhere around 45-55 is a good price target, if it drops i may buy back in but right now it's put of tilt on the original basis on which i purchased and would rather put my money somewhere else. Why not just sell your initial investment (and maybe slightly more) and use the rest as ""play"" money? This way you still have some skin in the game and if it keeps going up you can set yourself goals of when to sell (e.g. every 5-10% increase sell X percent) Set a stop loss order on the stock. Start selling a couple of weekly calls one at 5 OTM and the other at $10 OTM, that will net you somewhere around 125 to $150 a week. If they are assigned, then continue on until you sell however many you are comfortable with selling. You may want to consider keeping your principle of $20,000 in stock or less.       

This is not Financial advice this is just the opinion of another idiot on the internet. 

If you listen to this advice, you may find yourself in deep caca. When insiders start selling then sell too. I've been trimming. You buy more when it goes down if you think it's a good stock, you sell some when it's high but never all of it.  There will always be dips and highs.  I won't start selling till it hits triple digits and I started in the 20's. As somebody who has been greedy and lost a lot take your gains Same bought from around $30 all the way down to the bottom. Watched my entire portfolio also get cut in half during that time. I sold all my shares a few weeks ago at around $50 with an average buy-in price of $13.50 around 450 shares. I honestly didn’t think it would be able to go even higher, but oh well. PLTR saved my portfolio. investing in individual stock is risky. if i was you at minimum id be selling the majority of it and putting it in ETFs like VOO, VTI, SPY, for the s&p. From there diversify how you see fit. Why not trim your initial investment or 20%? You got in a bit lower than me. I sold yesterday. Take your win and put it into index funds.

You can sell some and keep some, but whats the point. It sounds like you dont have conviction at this price point Sell half if you want to hold for another handful of years, it will likely pull back at some point in 2025 IMO. I’d take it and run My general rule of thumb is sell half if I believe in a stock that still has room to grow, but has given me huge returns. Reinvest the other half when you find something better, and use a stop loss to secure the other half if you ate uncertain about it's future. Most brokers offer trailing stops, if not you can just move it as the orice increases. Take out 20k and let the rest go. If I was worried/stressed, I would pull out the 20k initial investment and let the rest ride. Ask yourself a year ago. If that you says yes then sell. I sold 1/2 my PLTR this week, now it's all house money. I'll just let it sit forever (well next 35 years) and see what it does. Nothing crazy just 25 shares I got at $15-25. I shaved off a lot of positions while we wait to see what trump actually does. I keep a FOMO on big run-ups that could go higher, so I use a trailing stop-loss percentage from its peak. Usually 10-15%, as it keeps going-up then I look like a genius while if it drops then a small loss from was the high point. There is certainly a chance this becomes a 1-3 trillion dollar company if so and you missed out would that piss you off more? Or be holding and having this thing crash into single digits piss you off more. This is how to answer this question I would take profit now tbh. Warren Buffet says to invest in great companies with great management, you don’t buy and sell based on how the wind is blowing. I say PLTR checks those boxes, it’s a forever hold Why’d you buy in in the first place? Do you believe the company will grow more? Has your initial investment thesis changed? A rule of thumb is this: if you had $42k in cash would you buy it today at the current price?  If the answer is yes, leave it.  If the answer is no, sell it.  If the answer is maybe, sell a portion. I bought in at $20 in early 2021, sat through the entire ride to $40, watched all those profits evaporate, promised I wouldn’t let that happen a second time and now I sold at $65. Still it sucks seeing the price climb even further, valuations are getting absolutely ridiculous now. I will never feel bad about takinf profit at over 200% return, yet I somehow still envy those holding it. It seems like PLTR may take a ridiculous trajectory like GME and TSLA have done in the past. You’re supposed to have that figured out before you make the investment. Bad practice = bad results Is it in a tax efficient account? If not, id just keep it… is $20K life changing money? Probably not, just keep betting on them. Well I am still holding 200 shares of Lucid that I bought at $25 and held through $60 but then slowly watched it fall and didn’t take profit because I thought surely it would go back up before I had to sell for capital gains. Look at me now 😭 Just take your profits, if you don’t want to gamble Same here with pltr, i’m up 90k and initial investment was around 34k. I want to take the profit but afraid it will go higher and miss the bigger gain. You need to start taking profit. Take back 20k, and let rest grow. I am selling some and taking some profit January 2nd. Don't want to pay the tax for last year but will defer it 12 months. Take your 20k out and let it run. Or take your 100% and leave the 20%. Maybe you will  feel less stress about it Why not cash out the original investment and let the profits ride? I’m in a similar position with RGTI and also never know when to take the money and run. I picked a price I’d be happy with and sold covered calls. If it surges I’ll swallow the opportunity cost but if it tanks at least I made some profit. get the bag and get out. i have a friend who used to be an engineer there who is completely flummoxed by the stock performance, given the quality of the product they ship lol Don't sell your winners. If your thesis of the company stands and you don't need the money, leave it alone, if you think it has fulfilled its purpose and the growth rate is less than what you expect, take it out and invest in something else. It is easy to buy a stock but hard to knowTR when to sell. There is no way to predict the ‘perfect’ time. If you will succeed long term trading stocks though you need a plan. If the plan works stay with it. If not learn and improve. I determine my sell price when I buy a stock. I sell covered call at that price every month until the price is reached. I also select a stop loss price, where I will exit at a loss. My broker has these instructions each month so if a stock spikes, or drops no contact is required. I will never be the guy bragging about my big win. I just make money.

In your case with PLTR I would set my STOP at $56. Would you be happy to sell at $100 given current projections and revenues? I would. So sell a covered call for strike $100 for Jan 17 and pocket $1.00 per share today. Repeat until target reached. Next month if price has gone up you may wish to increase your stop price. If it flattens out you may lower the strike on the call. 

But don’t just buy and hold (and pray). Make money now and have an exit plan! At least take your initial investment out Sliding scale based on conviction. If you are up to date with the company (as you should as an investor) you should form a view of how profitable you think the company will be in x years time. 

Ideally, you hold it forever until you need the money. If you recognise for example a 50-50 risk, e.g if they are investing a lot into R&D and there are clear competitors in sight and it's anyone's game, trim accordingly. 

If you don't know why you're in for, or have weak conviction, always fine to cleanly exit the position if you find something you feel more strongly about. You won't get the answer you're looking for if you don't provide a more thorough background.  Everyone always says sell and take the money,  but if you don't need the money, just let it ride.  The more you trade, the more chances you have to be on the wrong side of things. Case by case basis. PLTR Is objectively wildly overvalued at this point even tho the chart and options flow suggests higher for a little bit longer. If I were you, I’d sell at least half and set an order to rebuy it substantially lower for the eventual pullback. 

For reference regarding how wildly overvalued it is, it is trading at 51x NTM revs. The next highest saas stock is IOT at 20x. https://x.com/jaminball/status/1865141793605718525?s=46 Congrats on staying with them and your gains. I wish I stayed with NVDA but I got out after some terrific gains. I suggest you take out your $20k and buy something else, and let your other ~$20k run for a while. Good luck. Again 
I wish I had taken my own advice 

If it's good enough to screenshot and brag, it's good enough to sell AND RUN FOR THE HILLS

Can't get rugged if you aren't on the carpet It's super expensive at the moment. The valuation at this level is pricing in very aggressive earnings growth for the next few years. A single bad earnings print could send the stock In free fall. But there's no guarantee that it will go down at all. Earnings could catch up and it could just keep going. 

In light of this if you still believe your initial thesis on the business, you could take profit equal to your cost basis or even your cost basis plus the return you would have gotten from the S&P 500 or Nasdaq. At least for me that removes regret regardless of where it goes from here. You sell if it becomes overvalued. It’s that time for Palantir now I bought at $11 and I'm not selling anytime soon. 😎 Sell your initial investment, roll with the profits we will never be satisfied unless u buy at the bottom and sell at highest top before it drops down for ever :) I disagree with “take out your investment so you’re only playing with house money.”

Why are people okay with losing all of their profits in the first place? People act like one stock is the only one that will ever double their investment. 

Sell pltr, take your 30k profit and enjoy it. Find another investment and do the same. There are literally hundreds of stocks that can do the same for you. 

I made an easy 10k-15k on pltr, then on Reddit, then on Rocket labs, then on archer, and now with soundhound.

You don’t need to be married to a stock. I’ll never understand people who hold a stock forever. Sell when it’s high, then rebuy when it dips or find a new stock to ride the wave. You can do this dozens of times per year versus only one. start a selling process.  how much & how frequently up to you! 1) what changed in your investment philosophy since you bought it? If you still have the same beliefs it probably doesn’t make sense, if you were speculating and got lucky it may make sense to lock in your gains….be honest with yourself. If you just got lucky with a hot stock there’s nothing wrong with that but don’t think it was your skills and make risky plays. 

2) what are you spending the money on? If you need it for a large purchase that’s one thing. If you’re just going to put it in the bank indefinitely, or make speculative purchases it may make less sense.

3) if you’re going to reinvest it what offers a better opportunity?

Only you know bro. Sell your original investment (or some more) and let the rest ride if you think there's a chance of more growth I bought my 1st 100 at $8. My next 200 under $15. 

I have no idea when to take profits. I feel like it's the next long term big winner like MS, Apple, NVIDA so far. Always take the money from individual stocks asap. Reinvest in indexes. Set a stop 1-3% lower than the most recent low. When i need the money in 20-30 years. I get paid two weeks and dont need cash. Sell half, reinvest in something else and let the other half sit 💎🙌 You can always take out your initial investment and let it ride I would sell all and invest into something else. I’m in SMCI. Bought $12k @ ~$27.

I’m holding until it hits $120. At that point, I’m selling 75% of my shares and holding the rest to shoot for $150.

You’ve got to pick your targets and stick with them. If you don’t and you regret it, you’ll blame yourself for trusting strangers on the internet. Sell your initial investment and let the house money ride Sell half of it Hedge. 

Sell x% maybe 50 or 30 or 70. I take profits when I think the price has gotten out of bounds When the people responsible for illegally manipulating the stock market are in a jail cell. If it was me, I would absolutely cash out my original investment.

As for the remaining funds, I'd cash out all of it less some ""fun"" money that I wouldn't mind losing if the stock zeroes out. When you start posting about it Keep it, it’ll double I sold back in February at around $24. I'm something of an investing savant. I’m not selling at the moment but I am tempted my average cost is $13.71. but I have a lot less stock than you do with about 50 shares. I would lighten your load of this stock personally unless the money and returns are insignificant to you. I sold Nvidia early and I’m still happy with my returns and decision. Buy low sell high. But plan for taxes. I bought 550 shares of now META when the original IPO crashed and burned.  When it hit $100, I sold enough to cover my original investment and a small profit and let the rest ride.  Recoup your original investment and a small profit, then no matter what happens to remaining investment, you still won. Just take out your initial investment plus a bit off the top and let the house run! That way you feel you got a win with it and then still feel good about letting the rest ride for more gains If you believe the company will still exist in 20 years in a somewhat better position than it is now…then don’t sell. I'm in similar position but lower average cost. 
I sold twice, once around 55 mark and again last week at 66 or thereabouts to recover double my original investment.   
Now I'll let it ride as it's all profit on profit... Accountant here

Long term cap gain is good on sale for tax burden, but I'd advise selling only if you need the cash for another investment prospect. Given your choice of palantir, you're probably youngish and more risk tolerant.

Don't be so quick to sell the principal. I know everyone has suggested that. But that's just a safe option.. no one knows the right option

- do you believe in palantir as a company enough to hold?
- do you need cash for needs/expenses 
- do you believe in another company as much as pltr 

Selling your principal will incur tax liability in a few months.
So, if you want to sell, wait until January. You'll have the entire year and 4 months to invest those proceeds.

Choose carefully! GL

PS, reddit told the GameStop guy to sell his options and called him a dope every month. Now he's worth millions. Then everyone who trashed him deleted their comments. Hold! My average is 28$ and I have another order for 100 shares at 71$. I’m gonna roll with it a bit longer. Cash out if you need the money I prefer Warren buffet advice on this. You sell when something changed with the company or the market has changed, and the company long term profitability is at risk. All great companies were overvalued at some point when they were growing.  Just look at Microsoft.  I agree that it could be volatile over the next year or two, but I’m expecting this to be a $500 stock at some point in the future. Sell at least half >  it’s a good sized portion of my entire brokerage account

So... is that big drop going to be a lesson like you thought, or are you going to wait for it to be a lesson in the future? 

Sell. You don't have to sell all of it. Pare your stake down to a reasonable amount of your portfolio. Keep a bit. You also will regret it if it goes bananas and you aren't in it. I would sell initial investment and hold.  PLTR is going to be vital in the new American military dictatorship. Take profit before the pigs get slaughtered. Yolo it. Keep going bro. Pull the initial investiment if you are getting butterflies. 

If you believe in something, why give up imo? 

Hate hearing all the stories of the people who get in early in Nvidia, x or y and wish they didn't profit take so early with those paper hands. 

Pullbacks happen, rallys happen, let it cook. Best advice I can give is stop dwelling on the what ifs. If you feel like it's enough then sell or sell enough to get back your initial investment and ride on ""house"" money. Hello OP! I'm not a major investor, I do not have many assets at all and I am learning ATM. I have a background in psych/social work, customer service and rn working for a financial institution. For whatever it's worth,  I've made 20% profit in a month with a very small amount! I'm ready to make some rookie errors and lose money soon 🥴 

Looking at the curves PLTR took these past 5 years, it seems like it went an all time low for many, many years. And it seems like you were right about it but ahead of your time. But looking at the timeline, I cannot imagine the stress of going through this low for so many years and still holding your position, you are definitely determined and rightfully so.

But more than this, I think the ppl in this thread that are going ""bro talk' and laughing at you are missing the point; if all the lines were grey and straight and the 40k+ you had right now was just money to invest, with the same optimism you had when you invested in PLTR, where would you allow yourself to allocate it? If a stock market crash/correction was to occur, what do you think would be the fair value of PLTR? If that long term vision and self assurance you had many years ago is still there - what made you over 100% profit - where would you allocate it right now, with the experience you now have? And more than this, what is your current financial situation RN? Can you afford to lose that gain? 

I might be stretching but I think, from what I've seen of the trends, that maybe you've been conditioned over the years to always think about PLTR often and what you need is some distance and some kind of exposure ""therapy""? I'm not in your position, but if I was in the best of minds I think I would start by selling very small amounts of my portfolio on high days and actively think about what are the current undervalued stocks I want to promote and invest in next so I don't waste my foretelling gift. Gradually, I think the hold it takes on you is going to fade out without too much of a shock. If you genuinely think PLTR will rise again, even after you're emotionally disinvested, then you can always reinvest the money when it's devalued and keep your gains. 

Hope you learn to trust yourself against all odds like you did when you initially invested in PLTR all these years ago. Good luck OP! generally if i’m worried about a position, i’d take out at least my cost basis. depending on how much i still like the position, i’d either leave the free shares or sell em. If you beat the SP500 for the year, take the money and run. Sell half Think about putting a (trailing) stop at around 10-15% below actual price. You will survive a dip and you keep the upside, if any. Don't sell your winners.  I'm up 2,260% on ANET right now NFA, but i think now is probably the worst time to take everything out.... Let it ride..

What you could do is take out 20% When you need the money. You had an exit strategy when you entered, right? If so, use that.

If you don't remember your entry strategy, you can put stoploss on 61.7 on fibinacci, (61.8 is typically the reversal if playing fibs). Let it stoploss to exit. If it never crosses, just do it again if the highs/lows change. Keep going for profit. Scale out gradually. You made money, nothing wrong with realizing some gains now. Stage 2 uptrend is intact. 

First exits. Wait for a pull of 20% to sell 1/3.  If that does not happen wait for a close below the 50 day moving average to put it on trend watch.  As long as it keeps make new highs, stay the course.  If it fails to make a new high and closes below the 50 day a second time sell 1/3.  This is the inception of the Stage 3 distribution.  The trend may resume but if not.....

Second exit. If it goes below the 150 day or 30 week average, sell half, which will be 1/3 if you have 2/3 left.

Once it goes below the 200 day it's probably done for a while.  Say good-bye. Buy low. Sell high. I'm up pretty big on tqqq. I've been pouring money in every time it's down and now I have too much! I might sell half and put the rest in qqq next 10% downturn from ath Short Deep ITM covered call @36 for 1 years Take out the money that it cost to buy the shares then the rest is just free money Sell it’s so overpriced Sell ATM covered calls instead of selling. Make a little extra juice on your way out Sell it. Then take $2000 and play around with call options several times lol. If not, take some profit, reinvest into another long term company that dishes out some decent dividends. This stock is at ATH’s. If you have plenty of shares, consider taking profits with 2/3 of ur share count. Keep the rest in for longer gains. The I sold some at $30 to capture my original investment.  Then I sold the rest at $37. :-(   But, look, I made money, so no regrets.  Waited 10 years to break even on GE, so sometimes, the peace of mind is knowing you made good returns for the time in the market.   Would I buy it back at a reasonable valuation?  Of course. I don’t allow any individual stock to be more than 5% of my portfolio. If it gets above that I cash out whatever is above 5%. If it’s a runner, let it run. That’s what I learned. If it’s not a runner, then grab your gains now. I would sell at 90, 95, and last quarter at 99… 100 is significant resistance level A lot of the time. You can sell there then re-buy later when it hits 50-70 since it’s extremely over valued I think it’ll pop eventually like smci did Sold mine last week.  Had since last year Sell some, keep rest. SELL sell half TLDR; Depends what you are going to do with it. My thing is always, do I have a better use for it? Better place to put it? I had to sell a my whole portfolio in July because a real estate land deal came up that I had my eye on for 3+ years, and I got it for about 20% less than I thought it would be. Once I bought, got it appraised, moved things around, borrowed against the property, replenished savings, It was September and everything in my portfolio was up, accumulatively I probably missed out on 40% returns had I not sold my stocks. But, long term, I think the land I bought will make 400% returns and no stress. It’s going to 100 in 2025. But if you want to sell, just trim 1/4 and set some different trailing stop levels on the other 3/4. 

Like 1/4 @ 10% trail, 1/4 @ 20%, etc. I sold half my position, holder since 6$ I started selling covered calls against my position until they got called away. Just did last week. Made about 3x plus whatever premiums I collected on covered calls. Very happy with that. I'm honestly relieved to be rid of them and not have to worry about a fallout. Happy for y'all if it keeps rising but I got mine with PLTR. Why not put in a trailing stop loss? I sold a bunch of AAPL and MEANT to do that and I occasionally calculate out my losses. It’s sad. Not financial advice, but I see a 100 💯 in the horizon. I am not selling yet. I bought it in 2022 at $10.00. That’s just me. Sell 70% I say hold it. I think it’s the leader in the category, the competition is choosing to join them rather than lose to them. Programmers love their platform. Guessing it will be 150 by the end of next year. Everyone is forgetting the best time in the markets is now through March. I would say long. If you are 100% up, consider selling half of it and you get back your initial invested amount. The rest of it just let it roll. Is it in a retirement acct? Sell half to keep your original investment and let the rest ride Tax optimised I have the same issue with NVDA  it’s the second or third largest position and I’m up 1,500 %. I do think there is still room to run so I’m holding on for now Why not take out your cost basis and let the rest ride for a while longer? The best quote I’ve hear all year was from a billionaire that said “I’ve never lost money by taking profits” ""at what point do I take the gains and run? ""   Well, I reckon your guess is as good as anyone else's and no worse that some wall street investor big wig guess would be.  And no one on  these reddit  subs is going to know either.  Without a crystal ball, deciding when to buy , hold or sell is  a crap shoot and always will be. One just has to make a decision one way or the other and own it, for better or worse. you can sell the initial 20k investment and let the rest run. Or you wait few more years and see where it goes. I m exactly on the same page, will probably wait and see , considering what pltr prooved in the last year it still seems a very interesting bet, even if at the Moment a little bit ovepriced. Look for another investment. Dollar cost average from one to the other. You sell when you see the company behind the stock are started to lack the drive and are getting lazy. Sell half and take out yer cost. Deffo take a good amount of profit!! I was buying here and there for the past four years and sold it all last month and put it all in etf and long stocks. My thoughts where to take the earnings and no be greedy. I also don’t believe in the company for as much as it’s worth at that moment. It could still go up but I have no regrets in more than doubling the value that I put in. Your mistake was not buying more when PLTR fell below $10.00.  If you held at $10 thinking it would get back to $36 you should have put another $5k or 10k and dollar cost average when it fell.  (I stated buying in the high teens and bought more as it fell).  You should sell $5,000 of shares while priced over $70.00, set a limit order to sell 50 shares at $80.00 and let the rest run.  Put your sales proceeds into VOO and a year from now see if the $$$ put into VOO did better or worse than the return on PLTR. Diversify. Sell some and buy something else with conviction. You are gambling and exposing yourself to too much volatility holding so much of your portfolio in something so volatile. There are many other great companies that you could have conviction with so start looking ! Diversify. Sell some and buy something else with conviction. You are gambling and exposing yourself to too much volatility holding so much of your portfolio in something so volatile. There are many other great companies that you could have conviction with so start looking ! Good time now, and enjoy it I have been asking myself this same question over the last few weeks. I work in banking and have seen an uptick in ordinary non savvy people coming in to wire money to purchase stocks and crypto on their own. This was the signal for me to start taking profits off. Blood money As I posted this I was thinking the same thing haha I made Palantir my largest position by far when it hit single digits and sold half when my position more than doubled in value, sold some more at $50 then $70. 

Im contemplating selling the remaining position because I no longer view the company as being good value as an investment. Even if they grow their revenues at 30% annually for 10 years, they’re still expensive. My rational mind causes me to ask the question: Would I be buying here if I did not already own it? And the unequivocal response is and emphatic “No!”. I 100% agree 

Do not feel bad for giving yourself a better life, think about something that you really need to get done with the money financially come to peace with it pull the trigger and then know that you can always play the market again in the future and hopefully get lucky. 

Report back with what you use the money for it'll all be a inspiration story for us regards I don’t entirely agree, American currency and most global currencies are completely disconnected from any backing. Numbers on screen are basically all money is now. Old valuation metrics value the dollar against something of tangible/complimentary value. I’m a value investor, you can sell now and take profit or believe the company will grow into and above its current valuation. Palantir is the future of big data handling and decision making using ai, there’s nobody even close. It would be shocking to me if Palantir isn’t a trillion dollar company in the next 5-10 years.

Edit: I hold around 10k shares total at a basis of $7.93. I’m not selling, I believe that this company will grow into its valuation and more. I see Palantir as a legitimate Tesla/Nvidia type play. I also don’t need the money, if you do need the money consider selling to make your life easier. It’s not worth struggling now for a possible payoff later. take out your initial investment and let the rest run.

i been holding since near ipo and i finally took my initial amount out at 60 Always do the opposite of what Reddit tells you Sell Great point, think it’s a bad case of the FOMO if I do and no matter where I look at the end of the day I’m not sure there’s a “right” answer It's the same logic as DCA but in reverse. I always like this as an answer. Extract your original cost basis and some to buy yourself something nice with, and then leave the rest to reevaluate later. Even if it somehow goes to 0 when you're not looking, you got something out of it and didn't lose anything. This. Rebalancing is smart. Take 10% every week. Reinvest it in NVDA, GOOGL, META, or one of the more reasonably priced big tech names. You can still hang on to 30-40% of your current amount. Just diversify so that you don’t end up holding the bag as hard as you did last time. Well said. I’m gonna quote you. No joke, I had a stock rise to 100k profit with 3k investment in about 2 months. I was so surprised and greedy I lost most of it. Lesson learned, if I ever think to myself ""I wonder if I should sell?"" I should sell. This should be the top comment for converting short-term risk into long-term, stable wealth This is what I do with MSFT, NVDA and TSLA. Preach Legit I really like this. I always am grappling with the fact that I'm going to buy something else when I sell. So, I could trim a winner and end up using the proceeds to buy a loser. This is great way to mitigate that. Have you back tested this?  Because I'd bet you're throwing money away. If a stock moons and corrects same day does your trailing stop loss still work out? does stop loss trigger on sharp drops? I read somewhere that sometimes it's not possible to close the position on sharp drops cause there are no buyers. You did the right thing IMO. Doing the right thing does not always guarantee the best results, but it is my consolation in spite of sometimes getting sub-optimal results. Works great until a -30% earnings That’s what a coworker mentioned, take your money out then if you lose it’s only house money Google is an incredibly diverse portfolio of capability that is now key infrastructure that world commerce operates off of.  PLTR is a one trick pony trying to become a three trick pony of capability.  They have a lot of competition, they just happened to be at the edge in data fabric architecture. US government is already skeptical and struggling to use it in the way PLTR markets itself. I’m in the defense industry and i have the exact same reasoning for PLTR as you. They already have joint ventures with L3Harris and a few other contractors. This will only grow and they will become part of the whole supply chain. The only thing I would look out for is other upcoming competitors which for now are very few if closed to non. [let it ride!](https://fortune.com/2024/12/07/peter-thiel-network-trump-white-house-elon-musk-david-sacks/) And the great thing about PLTR is they arent limited to government. There are commercial applications for their software.

I think the reason for the fear is they are B2B. Not being B2C means many on Reddit don't have access to the product to form opinions. So they have to instead rely on earnings metrics and past performance. Interesting perspective, but not what most investors will tell you. I know way more people that wished they sold a hot stock than held. This doesn’t apply to individual stocks. Average lifespan of sp500 companies is 20 years By the way, I’m just a regular guy with not the best history 😉 Don’t suppose you could point me towards something to google to understand this better?  Can’t say I’m familiar with this, and to be honest I bought in on the thought process of “I missed two other big stocks that i considered, time to go all in” and didn’t think past that. Short deep?  Sorry I don’t quite understand my friend. No sadly in a brokerage Yea. I bought it at $20. It fell to $7 and people were saying it was overvalued back then. Instead of panic selling I bought heavily in the $7-10 ignoring the noise and got my cost basis down to $13.

I am now up 460% and still wish I bought more in that range. Because not only were there questions of valuation. People even questioned what they did. Not many explained it and they still dont in these weekly Palantir threads. “If its good enough for a screen shot its good enough to sell”. I sold some at 71. It could easily go to 100, but the valuation just doesn’t make sense at these levels imo. I say this as a long term holder and believer. I have a “never sell / long term hold” lot too. Take out initial capital and let the rest run or wait till end of year sell 90% and let 10% run Sell 80% keep 20% Funny I posted roughly a same question in r/investing because I have run up over 90% in HIMS in less than a year. I hate short term capital gains but I think I'm cashing out.  I hope you did. And then look at what you could have made just keeping that $20k in a hysa for “many years.”   Just wanna say 120% on PLTR ain’t nothing…I’m up 500% there revenues are going to grow and sure they may trend sideways but there one of the only ones who sell big data processing to the government. They’re going to hold a nice monopoly and I’m here for it. At nearly $10 billion in Rev you would think their current valuation is too high? So if it goes back down to 10, you can make 5 percent? Why not just sell the whole thing. How did you find out about this company? Any other holdings you keep since IPO? I think you're at a point where punching out can't be a bad call. As others have mentioned let 10% sit. If the stock skyrockets to 300, great you have X shares still there and can reap additional benefits.

Analysts believe palantir is overvalued and most of its value is currently speculative. Is it a good bet? Probably. But it's still a bet

Why put it all on black when you can recoup 15k and reinvest that (or buy something nice) vs hoping it all goes the way of Tesla? That’s why you sell half, if it goes up you still feel good for getting more money and if it goes down you feel good for getting out and reducing your exposure Sell 70% let 30% ride longer if you have fomo. Digital Millennium Copyright Act? Good strategy for turning singles into doubles.  Not a good strategy for hitting a home run.  

My MSFT is up 850%.  Long term hold. No. It means that I limited my losses and this stock wasn’t meant to be at this time. Sadly, I learned this concept the hard way when my bitcoin mining stocks dropped and I was not quick enough to protect myself so I got clobbered Like playing blackjack, split 8’s, never hit with dealer showing a 5, etc.  Doesn’t always work out, but you increase chances of success by making the right moves on a consistent basis. Then it hits fast. Bang. Done House money is one way to think of it. 

It might be better to just view all the profit as your money instead, because it is. You’ll still be bummed if all the profit disappears because that was the whole point of the investment. I personally hate this way of thinking. The only question I ask myself is ""if I had the current value of my stocks in my bank account rather than in the stock, would I want to invest in this stock?"" If yes, hold, if not, sell. If yes, but not the full amount, sell a percentage.

It doesn't matter if you're down 50% or up 100%, that profit or loss has already happened and in both cases you should hold if you think it's going to go up (over a period of time that you're comfortable with) and sell if you think it will go down. I’m a fan of taking out the initial investment plus 50% that way I always have secured profits, the rest sits forever This is not Vegas.  If you are a trader and you want to book some gains that’s one thing.  If you are just investing, what matters is the future, the gain % is only relevant for tax implications.  If you really want to sell can you wait 3 weeks?  That would delay your tax liability by 12 months.  My top position is up 2500%.  Only reason I would sell is if I felt like that capital would be better somewhere else or if I felt my portfolio was out of balance. Please do this. You'll not regret it. OR take your money out + 10 to 20% profit. let the rest run. Yeah money that could be spent on. House. Lol Anything you take out will be assessed capital gains, so really take out the 20k+CG. Framing it as gambling is the wrong mindset to investing Psychologically it may help, but logically there is no such thing as ""house money"" here. It's your money You could potentially sell $20K worth which is what you put in. This is a good idea when you're not sure what way the stock is gonna go. 


Have you considered selling options on your position? A lot of people don't know that if you buy deep ITM leaps with a Delta of 1, the stock moves in parallel with the underlying. (The stock goes down 10%, your calls go down 10%)  The advantage here is that you can sell twice as many covered calls/puts as simply owning the stocks while incurring minimal additional risk. And if you can choose the right time to sell puts vs calls, you can increase your annual gains by 40%. Just make sure to rollover your position monthly to keep time decay at a minimum.

However, do make sure this is worth taking the short term capital gains penalty if you're considering it, cause it might not be worth it. Exactly. As of now if your the government and need data crunched you go to PLTR it’s not about the product it’s about the connections. They were the first ones to show up and be like hey government I can help solve your problem and now the government is sticking with them. And their owner / founder literally has their dude in the White House How many of those hot stocks had a cofounder  close to a Vice President when they were the hot stock? Google: ""What are Fibonacci Retracements""

The basic set 23.61%, 38.2%, 50%, 61.8% are psychological support and resistance values that can be used to advantage. Since you BOUGHT, I suggested that you sell/stop at 61.7 so that if it bounces again at 61.8, you don't stop out. You can short covered call at 36 for a years, and keep looking it. You can do half of it or all of them depend on the stock expensive, for me PLTR I will do all of them That's a lot of capital gains.  However, it is ordinary income in a Trad IRA. So there is that. 

I have a different problem. I some big gains in my Trad and Roth, diff stock,  and need to rebalance but don't have anything I want to buy. My exact move and price on Thursday . Me @ QBTS. When the only reason it's going up is because the CEO was on Fox News, yeah I'm going to have to cut my position in half. Interesting. Concur, pull your profits but always leave a chunk for fun. I think I’ll take this advice myself.  Treat me to some of my money. For sure. Take the gains and if the upside thesis is still truly there, leave some in to ride. One in the hand is worth two in the bush and all that. I’m not sure what you mean in saying that So is the mentality you have on it “hey this is a sure winner” and the % increase is whatever? Total revenue has little to do with it. They would need to operate for over 300 years at the current P/E to break even. If you believe that's a reasonable timeframe for your ROI, then sure, they have a good valuation  I just looked up the P/E. Dude, it's 381.70. It is SIGNIFICANTLY overvalued. 18x sales. They’d have to cut their share count via buybacks and stop issuing new shares. I expect they’ll likely conduct a secondary offering to raise funds at an elevated valuation. trending in stocktwits. dont advise following this idea tho

i bought coinbase on ipo day. almost back to breakeven 😂 If you have a stock with a trailing stop loss, and the stock moons. When it corrects let’s say within hours will that stop loss still take effect? Thanks Loool I meant reverse DCA Well said. Wish I thought of it. 😄 Trusting a stop on a gap outside of rth is pretty risky. 100% You can pull out your principle and what you would have gotten in spy and then only leave the part that was single stock gambling. The problem is that whatever you think is usually irrelevant Investing in a Roth IRA changes the entire scenario you have presented Dunno exactly. But first few that come to mind that close friends got hit by were Nortel and Exxon. Pretty sure they had close links to government at the time. So if I’m understanding it right, you’re selling short positions on covered calls?  Sorry could be the tomato soup but I’m struggling to understand this some. Why Yes….NGL sold some of my tech to them….but I agree they may have some pullbacks. I wouldn’t fret at 20-50% drops. I mean it’s nothing when you have 4x your money in a year or 2. They have strong unit profit margins, and they have 4.5 billion in deal value (kinda like receivables but it’s the government so PLTR is getting there money) strong “expansion” with customer expansion of 40% and again a 22% increase in deal value. Honestly well it technically is a liability it’s more like a price rise they identify they can charge 22% more for there product. They just hit profitability. It's normal for profit to be low when you go from unprofitable to profitable.



That said,it's overvalued for sure. But then people are now expecting it to replace huge portions of the government, which would make it a monster sized company. I'm not counting on that personally. Personally I sold 1k shares, have 4k left and just started hedging with long dated otm puts So many companies valued that way currently… What p/e ratios are usually considered safe? EIBDTA is 419 lol... They have no reason to need additional funds they are profitable why do you think that Perhaps but it is what drives your decision to sell Just the tax portion.  It’s still about the future. Absolutely not. Most companies are no where close to this. Apple is even almost 10x lower P/E.  Depends on the sector and the company. 

The technology sector as a whole has the highest. As of yesterday, the average is 51.9x with a 3-year average of 39.7x. 

People are obviously willing to pay a premium if they believe the company is really the best at what it does. So, if you think this company is the best and you're willing to pay $74 for every $0.20 of their earnings go for it. What are you even trying to say? Do you know what EBITDA (you have it in the wrong order) means? 

Also, not sure what you mean by ""419"" but I looked at their 9/30 financials and it's $121.23 million. Tesla had no reason to do so either, but when their valuation became excessive, Musk did the exact same thing. It's a prudent move by management to sell shares when valuation runs amok.

Nordstrom’s chances of going private? ,"""Kohl’s and Macy’s are still public after a lot of talk of going private.""

The former aggressively defended against offers in early 2022 including one for $64 (stock is now $15) and the latter talked about denying offers in part because they did not offer compelling value - meanwhile, Macy's is down 76% off the peak in 2015 and the stock was at the same levels in the mid 1990's.

""And do you think the board will accept $23,""

Will they? I'd lean towards no. Should they? 110% yes. 

"" Will others join and start a bidding war""

I wouldn't think there would be one. There has been this thesis that retail is a more valuable asset than it is for more than a decade now, starting with Sears and the ridiculous real estate thesis that went on for more than a decade before it went bankrupt. Sears REIT Seritage has cratered. Kohl's (which is now on its 3rd CEO in 6 years) getting a $64 offer? They should have said thank you and how fast can we get this done? Nordstrom making an offer for $23 ... 6 years after an offer for $50 was denied. If this offer is denied, another 5 years and maybe they can offer $10. 

Really feels like there's a part of retail with execs who would rather gradually ride the stocks to 0 while getting paid than create shareholder value and let someone else actually try to turn some of these companies (primarily M/KSS) around. Idk but the indecision is killing the stock price, nobody wants to buy at over 23 a share right now because of obvious reasons $23 is definitely lowballing it. With retail still struggling but luxury holding steady, I'd bet they'll need at least $27-28 to get the board's attention.",nordstroms chances going private,kohls macys still public lot talk going private former aggressively defended offers early including one stock latter talked denying offers part offer compelling value meanwhile macys peak stock levels mid think board accept id lean towards yes others join start bidding war wouldnt think would one thesis retail valuable asset decade starting sears ridiculous real estate thesis went decade went bankrupt sears reit seritage cratered kohls rd ceo years getting offer said thank fast get done nordstrom making offer years offer denied offer denied another years maybe offer really feels like theres part retail execs would rather gradually ride stocks getting paid create shareholder value let someone else actually try turn companies primarily mkss around idk indecision killing stock price nobody wants buy share right obvious reasons definitely lowballing retail still struggling luxury holding steady id bet theyll need least get boards attention,0.0,0.0735930735930736,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,2
